# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Embodied Intelligence Focus
Prioritize the understanding and application of Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence in robot design and control.

### II. Humanoid Robotics Design
Emphasize the design and development of humanoid robots and intelligent AI agents, focusing on their physical and cognitive aspects.

### III. Conversational AI Integration
Integrate GPT-powered conversational robotics for natural language interaction and voice command capabilities.

### IV. Real-world Deployment
Ensure the ability to deploy AI solutions in both real and simulated environments, bridging the gap between theory and practice.

### V. Adaptive Learning Experience
Provide a personalized and translated learning experience for users, including a RAG chatbot for content queries and optional Urdu translation.

### VI. Reusable Learning Modules
Develop reusable Claude Code Subagents for learning modules to facilitate modular and extensible educational content.

## Scope and Constraints

### In Scope:
- ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, URDF
- Gazebo & Unity: Physics simulation, Digital Twin, Sensors
- NVIDIA Isaac: AI perception, VSLAM, Path planning
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA): LLM integration, Voice commands
- Capstone: Autonomous humanoid robot performing voice commands
- Lab setup: Edge devices (Jetson), optional cloud simulation

### Constraints:
- High computational requirements
- Stepwise capstone project
- Optional personalization and Urdu translation

## Project Goals

- Build a RAG chatbot for content queries
- Provide personalized and translated content per user
- Create reusable Claude Code Subagents for learning modules

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a clear migration plan. All contributions and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
