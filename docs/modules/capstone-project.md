# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Overview
This capstone project integrates all concepts learned in previous modules to build an autonomous humanoid robot system.

## Learning Objectives
- Synthesize knowledge from all modules
- Design a complete humanoid robot system
- Integrate perception, planning, and control
- Implement autonomous behavior

## Project Components
1. System Architecture Design
2. Perception System Integration
3. Motion Planning and Control
4. Human-Robot Interaction
5. Autonomous Task Execution
6. Testing and Validation

## Implementation Phases
1. **Design Phase**: Create system architecture and requirements
2. **Integration Phase**: Connect all subsystems
3. **Testing Phase**: Validate functionality
4. **Demonstration Phase**: Show complete system operation

## Deliverables
- Complete humanoid robot simulation
- Autonomous task execution demonstration
- Technical documentation
- Performance analysis

This capstone project demonstrates mastery of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts.
